# Apache2 Cordova demos

These demos are not maintained by Jeeliz. Indeed we only do web development.
With these demos you can run Jeeliz Weboji on iOS in a native environment.
With Android it is easier since the `Webview` component can access to the webcam stream.

Big thanx to [davemee](https://github.com/davemee) who submitted a pull request to add this great workaround.
More details can be found here on [the issue #27](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizWeboji/issues/27).
